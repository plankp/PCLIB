# PCLIB

Plankp's C library

## What does this library provide

I planned on making this a library that focuses on data structures.
It might (most likely will) not be efficient, but it should be easy to use.

If you need any of the following, this is the right place for you:

*  Vectors (Array lists)
*  Hashmaps
*  Closures (including consumers, predicates, and suppliers)
*  Binary Tree
